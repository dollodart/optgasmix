# standard conditions hydrogen 
# molar mass: ~2 g/mol
# this is also around 2 proton masses for every molecule

# density: 0.09693 - 0.08078 kg/m^3 from Incropera

# thermal conductivity: 157 - 183 mW/(m*K) according to Incropera's Heat Transfer, and 177.9 mW/(m*K) in BSL at 300 K
# this is for 1 cm length 1 m^2 cross section and 100 K differnce (boiling water and ice) a heat rate of 0.183 kW
# this is physically reasonable, though small: a vacuum cleaner draws something 10 Amps * 120 V = 1.2 kW
# it is around 10 times less than the thermal conductivity of ice at 1.88 W/(m*K) from Incropera
# which is suprisingly high given it is around 1000 times less dense than ice

# viscosity: .009 cP = 9.e-6 Pa*s from Eng. toolbox, 89.6e-7 Pa*s = 8.96e-6 Pa*s from Incropera
# this is around 1 % the viscosity of water
# heat capacity: 3.46*R from the CRC, 28.6 J/mol*K = 3.43*R from Incropera
